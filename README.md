<h1>Full Stack NodeFarm</h1>

<p> I developed a full stack project with Node.js, HTML5, CSS3. This is a study I prepared to practice API Routing. 3 separate endpoints were created to redirect to Homepage, Product Details and Error pages. Products and some information were listed on the homepage. When you go to the detail page, more information about the product is given. </p>

Note1:`nodemon index.js`
Note2:`http://127.0.0.1:4000/overview`
